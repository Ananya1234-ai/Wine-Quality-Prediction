# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Recently, I’ve acquired a taste for wines, although I don’t really know what makes a good wine. Therefore, I decided to apply some machine learning models to figure out what makes a good quality wine!
Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows
1.To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
2.To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

Assignment during Online Internship with DLithe(www.dlithe.com)
